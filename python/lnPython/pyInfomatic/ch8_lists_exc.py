# Exercise 8.1 Write a function called chop that takes a list and modifies it, removing
# the first and last elements, and returns None.
# Then write a function called middle that takes a list and returns a new list that
# contains all but the first and last elements.

def chop(list):
    del list[0]
    last = len(list) -1
    del list[last]
    print list


def middle(list):
    i = len(list)
    return list[1:i-1]

list = ['a,','b','c','d','e','f','g','h','i']
print list
print chop(list)
print middle(list)


# Exercise 8.2 Figure out which line of the above programis still not properly
# guarded. See if you can construct a text file which causes the program to
# fail and then modify the program so that the line is properly guarded and
# test it to make sure it handles your new text file.



# Exercise 8.3 Rewrite the guardian code in the above example without two
# if statements. Instead, use a compound logical expression using the and
# logical operator with a single if statement.

# Exercise 8.4 Download a copy of the file from www.py4inf.com/code/romeo.txt
# Write a program to open the file romeo.txt and read it line by line. For each line,
# split the line into a list of words using the split function.
# For each word, check to see if the word is already in a list. If the word is not in the
# list, add it to the list.
# When the program completes, sort and print the resulting words in alphabetical
# order.
# Enter file: romeo.txt
# ['Arise', 'But', 'It', 'Juliet', 'Who', 'already',
#  'and', 'breaks', 'east', 'envious', 'fair', 'grief',
#  'is', 'kill', 'light', 'moon', 'pale', 'sick', 'soft',
#  'sun', 'the', 'through', 'what', 'window',
#  'with', 'yonder']


# Exercise 8.5 Write a program to read through the mail box data and when you
# find line that starts with From, you will split the line into words using the split
# function. We are interested in who sent the message, which is the second word on
# the From line.
# From stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan 5 09:14:16 2008
# You will parse the From line and print out the second word for each From line,
# then you will also count the number of From (not From:) lines and print out a
# count at the end.
# This is a good sample output with a few lines removed:
#     python fromcount.py
# Enter a file name: mbox-short.txt
# stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za
# louis@media.berkeley.edu
# zqian@umich.edu
# [...some output removed...]
# ray@media.berkeley.edu
# cwen@iupui.edu
# cwen@iupui.edu
# cwen@iupui.edu
# There were 27 lines in the file with From as the first word


# Exercise 8.6 Rewrite the program that prompts the user for a list of numbers and
# prints out the maximum and minimum of the numbers at the end when the user
# enters done. Write the program to store the numbers the user enters in a list
# and use the max() and min() functions to compute the maximum and minimum
# numbers after the loop completes.
# Enter a number: 6
# Enter a number: 2
# Enter a number: 9
# Enter a number: 3
# Enter a number: 5
# Enter a number: done
# Maximum: 9.0
# Minimum: 2.0
